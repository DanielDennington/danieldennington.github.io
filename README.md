## Here where I am showcasing all of the projects created in my College Capstone Course

### Inside you'll find the following:
- Original course projects from SNHU's CS program
- Enhancements/Modifications I made to those projects
- A written narrative explaining the design choices and technical aspects of each enhancement/modification
- A code review in a video format covering the original projects, along with my enhancement plan
