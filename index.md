<h1>Original Projects</h1>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">Original first project</h2>
<p>This was a computer graphics project I created using OpenGL and C++. At first I tried to make a kitchen knife but it turned out to be more like a Roman Gladius. This project isn't in a working condition due to how sensitive the development enviornment is for projects like these, but that is precisely why I chose to include this project. I wanted to showcase taking a non-functioning application like this one and modifying the idea of it into something else far more portable and enjoyable.</p>

<h2 align = "center">Original second project</h2>
<p>This is an implementation of a CSV file parser and Binary Search Tree implemented with C++. The overall project mimics an auctioning system with almost 18,000 rows and utilizes the BST to quickly manipulate the data stored in the CSV file and displays it into the IDE's terminal.</p>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">Original third project</h2>
<p>This project is a Jupyter Notebook that covers various Data Anaylsis methods to comb through datasets. This was a very tightly-guided project that didn't really allow for much free input on my end. It also didn't implement cleaning any part of the datasets, a common phase that is typically in every a Data Science project.</p>

<h1>Enhancements/Modifications</h1>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My first enhanced project</h2>

<p>For my first artifact I wanted to create a simple game to continue on the computer generated graphics theme. I also though this was a great way to familiarize myself with both Python and PyGame. For this particular project, I chose to recreate Space Invaders. In case you didn't know, this is a classic video game released in the late 80s. This is a rather simple rendition of the game. However it does feature most of major components of the game like the sprites, player movement, collision detection, a scoring system, and even some audio.</p>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My second enhanced project</h2>
  
<p>I actually created two separate projects for this one- one in Python and one in C++. The first project of this bunch utilizes several Python libraries that write data to a CSV file to simulate a database consisting of several different 'user' metrics for Data science and Machine Learning practice further on down the line, after I make slight adjustments to the Algorithms and Data Structures- hence my decision to include another subproject. This other project implements and manipulates an AVL tree in C++  that takes in user input and outputs the contents of the tree to the user's console.</p>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My third enhanced project</h2>
  
<p>I wanted to explore a Data Science project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. So, I went and found a CSV file online which consisted of real world data points concering the games played in the NBA from the 2004-2021 seaons. I then performed several data analytical techniques to visualize a few of the data metrics into several graphs. I also extracted several specific metrics for further evaluation like the most points in a game or the most blocks.</p>
