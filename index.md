<h1 align ="center" margin-bottom = "12px">Hello and welcome to my ePortfolio!</h1>


The first project is the packaged and released version for Windows-64bit of a simple game I made in UE4 utilizing both C++ and the Blueprint system. 

<h2>To explain my first project:</h2>

I created a simple video game in Unreal Engine 4 using C++ and Unreal's Blueprint system. I wanted to create a project that utilizes environmental design techniques to hide surface tiling along with a noise brush to generate uneven and more realistic terrian. To further expand on the project, I added two separate C++ classes to represent both the NPCs of the game and the Player character. I exposed those character classes to Unreal's Blueprint system to allow for further editing of them using Unreals In-Engine Editor. However, since I only wanted to focus on utilizing different tools and not the gameplay mechanics, I opted to only include a Camera, and not any movement capabilites to the Player character.


<h2>For my second project:</h2>
  
I actually created two separate projects for this one- one in Python and one in C++. The first project of this bunch utilizes several Python libraries that write data to a CSV file to simulate a database consisting of several different 'user' metrics for Data science and Machine Learning practice further on down the line, after I make slight adjustments to the Algorithms and Data Structures- hence my decision to include another subproject. This other project implements and manipulates an AVL tree in C++  that takes in user input and outputs the contents of the tree to the user's console.
  
<h2>For my third project:</h2>
  
I wanted to explore a Data Science project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, so I found a CSV file online which consisted of real world data concering the games played in the NBA from the 2004-2021 seaons. I then used performed several data analytics techniques to visualize a few of the metrics in several graphs, as well as extracting other metrics and displaying to the screen.
