<h1 align ="center" margin-bottom = "12px">Hello and welcome to my ePortfolio!</h1>

<h1 margin-bottom = "12px">First and foremost, I want to bring some acknowledgement to all of the other coursework I dedicated most of my time and energy towards these past three years in order to finally realize my goal of graduating from college</h1>

<h2>Learning How to Collaborate in a Team Environment:</h2>
<p>In my CS-310 course, I learned how to utilize the popular version control system Git to collaborate in a team environment to implement various changes to a Jukebox application made in Java. In order to collaborate with my classmates, we used BitBucket’s online repositories to make pull request, code reviews, as well as running tests, and making the suggested changes made by my fellow classmates. We first started on smaller projects like working on a calculator together, but then we moved on adding to a online Jukebox application to showcase our favorite songs. This acted as a great way to get to know each other’s taste in music as well as share coding tips with each other. In CS – 250, I learned the different responsibilities of each team member of a project and the techniques used in the Agile methodology of software development lifecycle. I assumed almost all of the different roles throughout a single project that acted as a ‘vacation spot’ advertisement application, for a travel company made using Java. First, I acted as a SCRUM master and created the Team’s charter for the project to set expectations as well as establish timelines for meetings and general team collaboration. Then as a Product Owner, I used Excel to create various User Stories to better understand and define the scope of the project’s design. I also acted as a Developer for multiple weeks. I first added a few features following a guideline. I then received several expected ‘critiques’  back from the other fictional members and worked on implement their suggestions. I then made changes and finally packaged the application in a .jar file for portability purposes.</p>

<h2>Learning How to Communicate with Stakeholders:</h2>
<p>I used PowerPoint to promote a companywide security policy to encourage a Defense in Depth company approach to stakeholders. In that class project, I also established security principles, coding standards, and various other security policies in CS – 405. As I mentioned before, in DAT – 220 and in MAT - 243, I used data mining, data analyzing techniques. In DAT, I also was giving advice on various business problems using a real-world company’s historical data. The end goal was to convince stakeholders to implement a change in business and advertising strategies. While in MAT-243, I studied the logical reasonings behind analytical methods. </p>

<h2>Learning About Different Data Structures and Algorithms:</h2>
<p>In my CS- 320 class I applied various data structures and algorithms to create and implement an OOP design-based hospital registration application using Java. This system utilized various CRUD operations on a database to store and manipulate patient and doctor information. I also implemented various data structures like lists, sets, dictionaries, and matrices using Python in my MAT – 350 class. As a final project in that class, I also implemented various data structures and algorithms using Python to compress an image repeatedly. I also had to analyze the size and the effects of these compressions. In another project in that same class, I also provided network modification suggestions in simulated workstations using network throughput analysis.</p>

<h2>Learning About Software Engineering and Design Practices:</h2>
<p>I implemented JUnit tests all throughout various aspects of a system designed in my CS – 320 class. I also utilized Python & various CRUD operations on a database created in MongoDB to select specific dog breeds for a fictious Search and Rescue organization in my CS – 340 class. I created Android app with a locally stored user authentication, and authorization database in my CS – 360 class. Also, in IT – 315, I designed and implemented a student registration system using Java by using UML diagrams.</p>

<h2>Learning Secure Coding Practices and Security Policies:</h2>
<p>To highlight my knowledge of systems security, I’ll refer back to my work in my CS – 405 course as that project was not only directed towards influencing stakeholders and other employees. Another example of me implementing security features was the previously mentioned hospital database in the CS – 320 class. In that project I implemented an authorization and authentication system to only allow certain users, in this case system administrators, to manipulate the patient and doctor records that were stored in the system.</p>

<h1>Original Projects</h1>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">Original first project</h2>
<p>This was a computer graphics project I created using OpenGL and C++. At first I tried to make a kitchen knife but it turned out to be more like a Roman Gladius. This project isn't in a working condition due to how sensitive the development enviornment is for projects like these, but that is precisely why I chose to include this project. I wanted to showcase taking a non-functioning application like this one and modifying the idea of it into something else far more portable and enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<h2 align = "center">Original second project</h2>
<p>This is an implementation of a CSV file parser and Binary Search Tree implemented with C++. The overall project mimics an auctioning system with almost 18,000 rows and utilizes the BST to quickly manipulate the data stored in the CSV file and displays it into the IDE's terminal.</p>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">Original third project</h2>
<p>This project is a Jupyter Notebook that covers various Data Anaylsis methods to comb through datasets. This was a very tightly-guided project that didn't really allow for much free input on my end. It also didn't implement cleaning any part of the datasets, a common phase that is typically in every a Data Science project.</p>

<h1>Enhancements/Modifications</h1>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My first enhanced project</h2>

<p>For my first artifact I wanted to create a simple game to continue on the computer generated graphics theme. I also though this was a great way to familiarize myself with both Python and PyGame. For this particular project, I chose to recreate Space Invaders. In case you didn't know, this is a classic video game released in the late 80s. This is a rather simple rendition of the game. However it does feature most of major components of the game like the sprites, player movement, collision detection, a scoring system, and even some audio.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My second enhanced project</h2>
  
<p>I actually created two separate projects for this one- one in Python and one in C++. The first project of this bunch utilizes several Python libraries that write data to a CSV file to simulate a database consisting of several different 'user' metrics for Data science and Machine Learning practice further on down the line, after I make slight adjustments to the Algorithms and Data Structures- hence my decision to include another subproject. This other project implements and manipulates an AVL tree in C++  that takes in user input and outputs the contents of the tree to the user's console.</p>

<h2 align = "center" margin-bottom = "12px">My third enhanced project</h2>
  
<p>I wanted to explore a Data Science project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. So, I went and found a CSV file online which consisted of real world data points concering the games played in the NBA from the 2004-2021 seaons. I then performed several data analytical techniques to visualize a few of the data metrics into several graphs. I also extracted several specific metrics for further evaluation like the most points in a game or the most blocks.</p>
