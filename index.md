<h1>Enhancements/Modifications</h1>

<h2 align = "center">My first enhanced project:</h2>

<p>For my first artifact I wanted to create a simple game to better familiarize myself with both Python and PyGame. So I chose to recreate Space Invaders, a classic video game released in the late 80s. This is a rather simple rendition of the game, however it does feature most of major components of the game like the sprites, movement, a scoring system, and even audio.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<h2 align = "center">My second enhanced project:</h2>
  
<p>I actually created two separate projects for this one- one in Python and one in C++. The first project of this bunch utilizes several Python libraries that write data to a CSV file to simulate a database consisting of several different 'user' metrics for Data science and Machine Learning practice further on down the line, after I make slight adjustments to the Algorithms and Data Structures- hence my decision to include another subproject. This other project implements and manipulates an AVL tree in C++  that takes in user input and outputs the contents of the tree to the user's console.</p>

<h2 align = "center">My third enhanced project:</h2>
  
<p>I wanted to explore a Data Science project using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, so I found a CSV file online which consisted of real world data concering the games played in the NBA from the 2004-2021 seaons. I then used performed several data analytics techniques to visualize a few of the metrics in several graphs, as well as extracting other metrics and displaying to the screen.</p>
